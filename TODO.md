# TODO

- only first step source term aware
- SELF GRAVITY UNITS!!!!!
- clean helper data
- check self gravity energy conservation problems in the unsplit schemes
- go through all code and notebooks and clean
- write simple unit tests
- check Lax-Friedrichs implementation (constant alpha)
- progress bar significantly slows down simulations
