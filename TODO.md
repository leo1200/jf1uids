# TODO

- fix mhd units
- clean helper data
- implement advanced split for self-gravity
- check self gravity energy conservation problems in the unsplit schemes
- go through all code and notebooks and clean
- write simple unit tests
- check Lax-Friedrichs implementation (constant alpha)
- progress bar significantly slows down simulations
